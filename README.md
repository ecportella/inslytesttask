## Test automation for Insly Demo Instance.

Hello, this is the project for the test automation of the Insly Demo Instance.
It was written in __Java__ and the technologies used was __Maven__, __Selenide__ (Selenium wrapper), __TestNG__ and __ExtentReport__.

With __Maven__ we control dependencies and we can run the project from the terminal.
__Selenide__ is a wrapper of the Selenium WebDriver and was used in this project to automate the browser.
__TestNG__ was used to organize with annotations and test some assertions.
Finally, __ExtentReport__ is used to create a report from the tests runned.

Shall we prepare our machine to run those scripts?

#1. Preparing

...In order to run the scripts, we need to install on our machines the __Java JDK__ and the __Maven__ technologies.
...Make sure to install the latest version of each technologie.
...After you do install, make sure you can use then from wherever you are adding then to your local path variable.
